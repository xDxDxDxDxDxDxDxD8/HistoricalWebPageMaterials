      <h3> <a name = "Introduction"> Introduction </h3>
      <p size = "6"> <br clear = ”left” /> Napoleon was a major player in European politics, influencing all the monarchs of Europe and killing millions in his attempt to preserve his empire and expand it. Napoleon undoubtedly made history, but the subject of his intentions and his morality are still a matter of heated debate. Napoleon is famous for many things, from uniting Europe (except for Britain). He reformed rights (although only for males), gave religious freedoms, crashed the European economies through a series of expensive wars, and ultimately, many million deaths. This article will analyze the life of Napoleon, his accomplishments, his mishaps, and his dream of making history. </p>

      <h3> <a name = "NapoleonEarlyLife"> Early Life </h3>
      <p> Napoleon was born Napoleone di Buonaparte, to a relatively small family of Corsican nobility. He moved to France when he was nine, and he was able to attend a school that was relatively prestigious, and in school, he was constantly bullied by other students for his accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms and inability to speak French quickly. Although later in life, Napoleone became very proficient in French, he still had a Corsican accent when he spoke. He loved to read, and briefly considered becoming a writer when he grew up. On the completion of his studies, Napoleone was admitted to the École Militaire. Due to the death of his father and lack of funds, Napoleone was forced to complete his two-year course in only one year, but still graduated as the first Corsican ever to do so. </p>

      <h3> <a name = "NapoleonEarlyCareer"> Early Career </h3>
      <p> In 1785, Napoleone was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment. He attemped to get up the ranks, but he failed, dispite his obvious talent, due to the prejudices that the current French society had. The French Revolution broke out in 1789, and he fought honourably in Corsica against royalists, revolutionists, and nationalists. Following an argument with the island's governer, Pasquale Paoli, Napoleone and his family left their native island and headed for the French mainland at Toulon in 1793. After this incident, Napoleone began calling himself "Napoléon Bonaparte". </p>

      <h3> <a name = "FrenchRevolution"> Role Played in the French Revolution </h3>
      <p> In the July of 1793, Napoleon published a pro-revolution/republican pamphlet titled <i>"Le souper de Beaucaire"</i> or <i>"Supper at Beaucaire"</i>. This article drew the attention of the brother of the leader of the Revolution, who appointed Napoleon to an important position, the senior gunner and artillery commander of the French forces arriving at Toulon. Toulon was the main French naval port/city, and one of the largest suppliers of military and domestic resources. It had invited the British to their city, then surrendered. This was a huge blow to France, and they had sent their best generals available,  Jean François Carteaux, Jacques François Dugommier, Jean François, Cornu de La Poype, and Hughes Charlot. Due to Napoleon's publication of Le souper de Beaucaire and his favour from Augustin Robespierre, he was appointed as the commander of the artillery. Napoleon made a plan to attack the city; he would take a hill on the south side of the port of Toulon, then place the longest range artillery there to bombard the port, which would force the allied troops to retreat. After initial dismissal of Napoleon's plan, the commander of the French army, Jacques François Dugommier, realized that due to the strong defences on land, the only way to take the city without damaging the captured French Navy was to accept a surrender, which could only happen if the allied troops left, which could only be achieved if they used Napoleon's plan. Therefore, Jacques François Dugommier decided to apply Napoleon's plan. It worked to perfection. The allied troops were driven out, and Toulon was taken by surrender. </p>
      
      <p> After Napoleon's victory at Toulon, he gained nation-wide fame as the savior of the republic. After Toulon, Napoleon was put it charge of the defense of Paris. There, on 13 Vendémiaire of the new French calendar (October 5th), 1795, he repelled a rebellion with his troops, and cleared the street with <i><b> "a whiff of grapeshot"</b></i>. This increased his popularity even more, and he gained nationwide fame again as again the savior of the republic.
      
      <p> The government of the First French Republic was nervous at the amount of popular and military support that he had. Therefore, they decided to give him the position of<i> Commander of the Army of Italy </i>. In the meantime, The French Republic was invading Austria, who had declared war on them in an attempt to restore the monarchy. They planned to do so through Southern Germany, Central Germany, and Italy. Each had a general in charge, and all three marched towards the Austrian capital, Vienna. The German columns were defeated, but Napoleon suceeded, repelling an attack from an Austrian army, then marching across Italy, beating Austrian armies at Montenotte, Dego, and Cheraso. Piedmont of Italy was forced to sign an unfavourable peace, and the Austrians lost all influence in Italy. Following defeating the French armies in Germany, Archduke Charles of Austria Withdrew his men to defend Vienna after hearing of Napoleon's victories in Spain. Naptoleon marched towards Vienna, planning to take it and end the war. He won at Codogno, Lodi, Mantua, Lonato, Castiglione, Bassano, Cembra, Calliano, and Rivoli. As he neared Vienna, defeating multiple Austrian armies, the desperate Austrian emperor had sued for peace. Thus ended the War of the First Coalition. This time, the government was again nervous of Napoleon's power, and since the previous elections had elected an alarming amount of royalists, Napoleon sent his army in a <i>coup d'état</i> on September 4th, 1794, known today as <i>The Coup of 18 Fructidor</i>. This coup put the republicans in power again, but dependent on Napoleon. </p>

      <img src = "NapoleonCrossingAlps.jpg" alt = "Napoleon Crossing the Alps" align = "left" width = 394px height = 480px>
      
      <p> Napoleon could not muster a strong enough navy to defeat the world-renown British Navy; so he decided to destroy the British economy. He attacked Ottoman/British Egypt, in an attempt disrupt British trade with India. He was extremely successful on land, finding ancient Egyptian antiques, most famous of which was the Rosetta Stone. Although Napoleon was unchallenged on land, destroying everything the British and Ottoman armies could throw at them, his navy was defeated by the British naval genius Sir Horatio Nelson. This forced a retreat, and Napoleon left by himself with a few thousand of hs most combat-ready troops first, leaving the rest to their own accords. </p>

      <p> Even though he had lost in Egypt, Napoleon was still welcomed home as a returning hero, and government propaganda made the campaign look like a huge success. The War of The Second Coalition had ramped up, France first losing multiple battles, and then winning a few. Although France had survived, the Directory was too weak, and the coffers were empty. Napoleon, seeing this, and possibly the conversations to dismiss him and his own ambition, made another coup d'etat on November 9th, better known as the coup of 18 Brumaire. After this coup, Napoleon established the Consulate, with himself as first consul. This essentially made him a dictator. </p>

      <p> After 18 Brumaire, Napoleon took hold of the War of the Second Coalition. Napoleon's plan was to suprise the Austrians by marching through the Alps, through the Saint-Bernard Pass, as his hero Hannibal Barca had done 2000 years earlier. He sent an  army to relieve a besieged André Masséna, and confronted the Austrian army at Marango. There, after initial setbacks, Napoleon crushed the Austrian army. At the same time, Napoleon's General, John Moreau, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Austrians at Hohenlinden. These two crushing defeats resulted in the Austrian sue for peace, and the Treaty of Amiens was signed in 1802. During the peace from 1802-1804, Napoleon sold the Louisana territory for funds (15 million USD). The peace with Britain, however was not to last. In the same year, The British declared war on France, due to unhappiness with the treaty and general disconsent. Napoleon was not bothered by this however, as he had different things to attend to. On December 2nd, 1804, Napoleon would do something that was unprecedented, one that would shake the entirety of Europe to its core. </p>

      <hr color = "black">

      <img src = "CrowningOfNapoleon.jpg" alt = "Napoleon Crowning" align = "right" width = 480px height = 301.5px>

      <h3> <a name = "ThirdCoalition"> The Crowning of Napoleon and The War of the Third Coalition </h3>
      <p> Napoleon used the newfound internal stablity to let the country recover. After an assasination plot in January, 1804, Napoleon used this as an excuse, saying that only as emperor could he maintain peace and no attempts on his like would be made. This was faulty reasoning, but seeing popular support, Napoleon went on with his plan. Napoleon crowned himself Napoleon I on December 2nd, 1804. When he became emperor, Napoleon restored the ancient rank of<i> Marshal of the Empire</i>, and appointed 18 out of his best generals to the position. In addition, Napoleon drafted and published the Napoleon Code, which gave everyone equal rights, regardless of race, religion, or social status. It seemed great; until you consider that it was only considering men. All woman were stripped of any power, and the Napoleonic Code established males as equal and the head of each household. Because of the crowning of Napoleon, a British-Swedish alliance formed, who convinced Austria and the Russian Empire to join the Third Coalition. The Third Coalition declared war, and Russia and Austria sent armies to invade France. </p>

      <p> When the Third Coalition declared war, Napoleon was at Boulogne, preparing for a British invaion. At learning of the invasion by Austria, Napoleon rushed over with astonishing speed, with his newly made La Grande Armée. At this point, it was Napoleon's army at its best. The Grande Armée had 200,000 men organized into 7 corps, and each corps was commanded by a marshal. Napoleon rushed to the Ulm Forest. The commander of the Austrian army, Karl Mack, had not anticipated such a powerful army to arrive so fast, and so were extremely unprepared for Napoleon's attack. Napoleon, instead of suprise-attacking Mack, marched his army around him at lightning speed. He quickly encirles Mack's 60 thousand strong army, and forced them to surrender after a few attempts at breakout in just over a month. It was Napoleon's masterpiece. The best campaign that he had ever fought. <i>"I have destroyed the Austrian army by simply marching"</i> Napoleon had said after the battle. Hearing of the news of Mack's Defeat, Senior Russian General Mikhail Kutuzov retreated with his corps of around 100 thousand men, as he now knew Napoleon was commanding almost 200 thousand, and could not fight him in a pitched battle without reinforcements. At the same time Napoleon was crushing the Austrian army at Ulm, British Admiral Horatio Nelson was crushing the allied Spanish-French fleet at Trafalgar. Although he had died in the battle, he secured British naval supremacy for the next century. Napoleon did not know of the disaster at Trafalgar, and so he continued with his campaign. </p>
      
      <p> Napoleon marched to Vienna, and Kutuzov could do nothing but watch as his army was too small to confront Napoleon. Although his position in the war was triumphant, there were still many enemy armies in the field. Seeking an open battle as his supply lines were overextended, Napoleon tried every which way to lure the enemy into an open battle. He pretended that his army was smaller than it was, that his army was cripped by supply problems and disease, even abandoning advantagous positions such as the Pratzen heights. The allies fell for it and engaged Napoleon at Austerlitz. During the battle, Napoleon deliberately weakened his right flank, hoping to lure the allies into a trap. The allies fell right into his trap. They sent more men to attack Napoleon's right flank, weakening their center on the Pratzen heights. Napoleon prompt sent men exploit this, destroying the enemy center, routing the right, and surrounding the left. It was another masterpiece by Napoleon. With 36 thousand dead or wounded enemies, and 9 thousand casualties, Napoleon had again proved that he could stand up to all the monarchs of Europe. Austria sued for peace, and Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. In addition, he forced Austria to formally dissolve the Holy Roman Empire, which had been around since the time of Otto the Great, in the 900s. This was a great embarrasment to Austria, which only made them hate France, especially Napoleon, even more. </p>

      <hr color = "black">

      <h3> <a name = "FourthCoalition"> The War of the Fourth Coalition </h3>

      <p> The allies were still bitter over their loss at Napoleon's hands in 1805. They reached out to Prussia; which had been debating whether or not to join the war since 1803. Eventually, the pro-war party, lead by the the King's wife, Queen Louise, won the debate. At the convincing of his wife, and his own desires to control central Europe, King of Prussia, Fredrick William III declared war on France. </p>

      <p> Prussia was a great addition to the allies; they now had the elite Prussian army on their side; trained by the infamous Fredrick the First the Great. The Prussian army was commanded by veteran commanders with decades of experience, and all of their soldiers were first class. The elite Prussian army consisted of 133 thousand infantry, 40 thousand cavalry, and 10 thousand artillerymen, as well as a few thousand engineers, reserves, etc., in total amounting to just over 200 thousand fighting men. But the Prussian armies had let themselves bask in the light of their victories and was no longer the elite force the Fredrick the Great had commanded, with it's commanders becoming arrogant and the soldiers rash. This would become disturbingly clear in the War of the Fourth Coalition. </p>

      <img src = "NapoleonJena.jpg" alt = "Napoleon Jena" align = "left" width = 426px height = 360px>

      <p> Although the Prussian army was only a shadow of it's former self, it was still a force to be reckoned with. But the ultimate mistake the Fredrick III had made was to declare war without consulting his newfound allies. This left him isolated without any support, and as Austria was still to weak from the deafeats of the last war, Napoleon seized on this opportunity, marching into Northern Germany with 180 thousand troops with lightning speed. Fredrick and his allies were not ready for this attack, and were forced to retreat, with Napoleon securing lands to the right of the River Saale. Opon learning of the whereabouts of the Prussian army, Napoleon swung west, aiming to defeat the Prussian army before it could be reinforced, sending his Marshal Davout to pursue the rear guard. But for once, Napoleon was wrong. The contingent that Napoleon attacked at Jena was actually the Prussian rear guard, while the "rear guard" that Napoleon had sent Marshal Davout to chase was actually the main Prussian column. Napoleon did not know this, however. As he flooded the Prussian rear guard with a mixture of superior numbers of stratigic cannon fire at Jena, more than 10 mile away, near the village of Auerstedt, Marshal Davout was fighting for his life. </p>

      <p> Marshals Davout and Bernadotte had recieved orders from Napoleon to reinforce him at Jena. Unexpectedly, Davout just so happened to encounter the main Prussian army of over 60 thousand men, against Davout's just over 20 thousand. Davout stood his ground, sent messengers to Napoleon, and tried to hold on for as long as possible. At this point, the condition of the Prussian army began to show itself. There was almost not a single Prussian commander under 60 years of age, and they still used tactics from the time of Fredrick the Great. The soldiers were let bask in their previous victories, and had barely ever trained. In addition, the communcations between the Prussian contingents, to put it nicely, was absolutely garbage. The 71 year olf Duke of Brunswick commanded the Prussian forces, and tried to send men to dislodge Davout. He could not do so, and ordered a full-scale frontal assault. This failed as well, with huge casualties, including the Duke's eyes. The Prussians finally retreated after almost ten attempts to break Davout's line, and a French counter-attack. Davout suffered casualities of around 7 thousand, while inflicting more than 13 thousand casualities on the enemy. </p>

      <p> At the news of Davout's victory, the French Emperor's first reaction was exclaiming <i>"Your marshal must be seeing double!"</i>, citing Davout's poor eyesight. His disbelief quickly turned to praise, proclaiming Davout "The Iron Marshal". Meanwhile, Marshal Bernadotte was almost court-martialed for failing to come to Davout's aid. Exploiting his victory, Napoleon entered Berlin triumphantly, allowing Marshal Davout's Corps to enter first as a tribute to their victory at Jena. Meanwhile, Fredrick William was leading the shattered remains of his formerly glorious army to Königsberg (modern day Kalingrad). The proud Prussian were absolutely decimated by Napoleon's lightning campaign, capturing over 140 thousand soldiers, more than 2 thousand cannon, and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in less than a month. As Historian David Chandler said:  “Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered”. Despite their catastrophic defeat, the Prussian refused to negotiate with the French, as Fredrick was confident that the Russians would come and save him. </p>

      <p> Indeed, the Russian Tsar Alexander I sent Levin August von Bennigsen to relieve the beleaguered Prussians retreating towards Königsberg. The Prussian and Russian armies met up, and Bennigsen counterattacked. Davout, who was on the front, fell back, inflicting losses. Napoleon, instead of seeing this as a disadvantage, came up with a plan. He ordered Davout to continue retreating, sending a courier to Bernadotte to encircle the now everextended Russian army. Luckily for the Bennigsen, however, the courier tasked with dispatching this information was fresh out of a military academy, and when captured, did not destroy the message. Therefore, Prince Bagration informed Bennigsen, who retreated immediately. The French Emperor was furious. Napoleon, seeking an open battle and still fuming at his failure to encircle the Russian army, Napoleon gathered his forces and chased the Bennigsen relentlessly, with Bennigsen only managing to escape by the skin of his teeth. Eventually, though, as Napoleon neared the Prussian stronghold of Königsberg, Bennigsen was forced to stand at fight. Bennigsen made his stand near the village of Preussisch-Eylau, where Napoleon converged on him. </p>

      <p> At Eylau, a bloodbath ensued. It was the first battle Napoleon had fought that concluded to be indecisive, and the battle was one of the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars. After the battle, Marshal Ney exclaimed, <i>"What a massacre! And without result!"</i>". Hostilities continued, with Bennigsen escaping across the Vistula River. Napoleon anticipated that Bennigsen would cross at Friedland, and sent Davout and Lannes to patrol the area. Bennigsen did indeed attempt to cross at Friedland, and Davout sent a message to the French Emperor, saying to his Aide-de-camp, <i>"Run your horse to the groud if you have to, but tell the Emperor that we are facing the entire Russian army!"</i>. Napoleon rushed to Friedland, surveyed the position, and then attacked. The Russians were surrounded, one side by Napoleon, the other by the river. They were annihilated. At this, Alexander I sued for peace, and peace was made at the Treaties of Tilsit. The Prussian got the short end of the stick; losing half of their lands. </p>

      <h3> <a name = "FifthCoalition"> The Peninsular War and the War of the Fifth Coalition </h3>

      <img src = "DukeOfWellington.png" alt = "Duke of Wellington" align = "right" width = 351px height = 480px>

      <p> Napoleon had agitated many countries, and when Portugal refused to obey his orders, he marched to Lisbon. It seemed like another easy victory, but Napoleon had secretly attempted to occupy Spain. The full reasons of this are unknown, but possible reasons include:

        <ul>
          <li> Personal ambitions </li>
          <li> Discontent with the current weak rulers of Spain </li>
          <li> An urge to reform the stuck and corrupt Spanish political system </li>
          <li> Mainly probably his desire to make Spain more compliant </li>
        </ul>
      
      Either way, Spain was occupied, and Napoleon instated his brother, Joseph Bonaparte as the new rule of Spain. Unrest quickly descended, however, and the people of Spain revolted against Napoleonic rule. Meanwhile, Napoleon was in modern-day Germany, at the Congress of Erfurt. At Erfurt, Alexander I agreed to defend France in the case of an Austrian sneak attack. Satisfied at this agreement, Napoleon rushed to Spain, where the situation was much worse than expected. Joseph had been deposed; The French army was decimated; the British were landing troops in Iberia with complete impunity. Napoleon quickly attacked with his veteran Grande Armée, crushing all resistance, and marching towards Madrid. At this point it is important to note that due to the crisis in Spain, many of the prominent Spanish colonies seized on this opportunity and revolted, resulting in the loss of almost all Spanish lands in the "New World". </p>
      
      <p> Either way, Napoleon marched towards Madrid without resistance, until he met a contingent of Spanish militia on the road to Madrid, at Somosierra. The positon was naturally and artificially strong, the mountain pass was fortified by man bunkers and trenches; the pass itself had infantry and many british cannon. Napoleon attempted an attack, but failed. Seeing this, Napoleon sent his elite Polish Lancers to charge through the pass, taking the cannon. Hearing this strategy, one of his officers said that it was impossible. At this, Napoleon famously said; <i>"Impossible? I do not know the meaning of the word"</i> (other sources have Napoleon saying this in other situations). His Polish Lancers bravely charged the pass, annihilating the cannon and infantry guarding the pass, and allowing for a French attack. When the Poles returned, Napoleon exclaimed, <i>"Poles, I proclaim you my bravest cavalry"</i>. </p>

      <p> After Somosierra, Madrid capitulated, and Napoleon chased British forces out of the continent. As Europe was again heating up, however, Napoleon returned to Paris to assess the situation. At Napoleon's leave, a (at the time) relatively unknown figure, Arthur Wellesley, future Duke of Wellington, arrived in Spain with a new British army. Wellesly would soon become Napoleon's greatest admirer; and his worst enemy. </p>

      <img src = "NapoleonWagram.jpg" alt = "Wagram" align = "left" width = 420 height = 295px>

      <br> 

      <p> In Paris, Napoleon found out that Alexander I had violated the terms put down at Erfurt, and he considered this a betrayal. Napoleon was in Paris, sure that Austria would not attack so suddenly; which they did. Archduke Charles of Austria attacked the French without a formal declaration of war, and Napoleon's subordinate could not understand his orders, so the front became chaos. Napoleon, sensing the confusion, rushed to the front and tried to calm everything down. He did so with some difficulty, and then crushed Archduke Charles at Eckmühl. Following the victory, Napoleon took Vienna and attempted to cross the Danube River under unfavourable conditions, and was ambushed by Archduke Charles. It was the first battle Napoleon had ever lost. He also lost his close friend and talented subordinate Marshal Lannes, who was hit in the leg by a stray cannonball. In defeat, Napoleon retreated back across the Danube, and gathered his forces for a new attack. The defeat also excited the rest of Europe, ready to rise up against Napoleon if Archduke Charles managed to again defeat Napoleon, this time in a more complete fashion. It was not to be. Learning from his previous mistakes of a hasty crossing, Napoleon gathered supplies and men for 6 weeks before crossing the Danube at low tide, and making sure that his bridge across was secure. <i>"The Danube,"</i> Napoleon proclaimed, <i>"No longer exists"</i>. With his larger army and better preparations, Napoleon crushed the Archduke Charles at Wagram, and forced an Austrian sue for peace. </p>

      <p> The treaty Napoleon forced was the harshest so far, with Austria losing 3 million subjects and 1/5 of it's population. It lost much of it's land but managed to keep itself in existence and not surrender the entire empire. After this peace, Europe had peace for 3 more years, in which Napoleon reformed French society, improved the economy, let the country rest, but most importantly, prepared for his Invasion of Russia. </p>

      <h3> <a name = "NapoleonRussia"> Napoleon's Invasion of Russia </h3>

      <p> The reasons for Napoleon's invasion of Russia, as with Iberia, is debated. Again, there could be multiple reasons (Ordered with likelihoods):

            <dl>
              <dt> Violation of the Continental System </dt>
              <dd> 
                <ul> 
                  <li> The Continental System was a continental blockade that Napoleon tried to force his defeated enemies to impose on the British, as he was unable to defeat them in the field (Britain never got out of it's island) </li>
                  <li> Alexander I had agreed to be added to the Continental System at the Treaties of Tilsit, but Napoleon found information that he was covertly allowing smuggling operations of British goods to continue (not prosecuting the smugglers). </li>
                  <li> Napoleon describes this at his reason while writing his memoir on St. Helena, but we have to be reminded that the memoir is biased towards Napoleon. </li>

                <ul> 
                  <li> The Duchy of Warsaw was made in 1807, after Napoleon had won the War of the Fourth Coalition. It took mostly Prussian lands and some Russian ones to create a new nation; one that was client to Napoleon but still existed in it some independence. This was Napoleon's attempt to restore Poland, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commenwealth used to be a major factor in European politics, until Prussia, Austria, and Russia exterminated it through many treaties that left Poland with no land left. This was not long ago, and Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw as a miniature Poland, and an attempt to re-instate a powerful European country as his ally. </li>
                  <li> Russia felt threatened by this, as having a powerful rival that hated them right on their doorstep was not something they wanted. </li>

      After the declaration, Napoleon mobilized the huge army that he was amassing to invade Russia. It consisted of more than 600 thousand men, aroud 150 thousand of them veterans that had served Napoleon for almost a decade. Napoleon's plan was to go into Russia, crush the field armies, and then force a sue for peace. Russian commanders at first wanted to confront Napoleon, but the cautious General Kutuzov convinced the Tsar and other generals to retreat, adopting a scorched
