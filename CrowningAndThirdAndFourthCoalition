      <h3> <a name = "ThirdCoalition"> The Crowning of Napoleon and The War of the Third Coalition </h3>
      <p> Napoleon used the newfound internal stablity to let the country recover. After an assasination plot in January, 1804, Napoleon used this as an excuse, saying that only as emperor could he maintain peace and no attempts on his like would be made. This was faulty reasoning, but seeing popular support, Napoleon went on with his plan. Napoleon crowned himself Napoleon I on December 2nd, 1804. When he became emperor, Napoleon restored the ancient rank of<i> Marshal of the Empire</i>, and appointed 18 out of his best generals to the position. In addition, Napoleon drafted and published the Napoleon Code, which gave everyone equal rights, regardless of race, religion, or social status. It seemed great; until you consider that it was only considering men. All woman were stripped of any power, and the Napoleonic Code established males as equal and the head of each household. Because of the crowning of Napoleon, a British-Swedish alliance formed, who convinced Austria and the Russian Empire to join the Third Coalition. The Third Coalition declared war, and Russia and Austria sent armies to invade France. </p>

      <p> When the Third Coalition declared war, Napoleon was at Boulogne, preparing for a British invaion. At learning of the invasion by Austria, Napoleon rushed over with astonishing speed, with his newly made La Grande Armée. At this point, it was Napoleon's army at its best. The Grande Armée had 200,000 men organized into 7 corps, and each corps was commanded by a marshal. Napoleon rushed to the Ulm Forest. The commander of the Austrian army, Karl Mack, had not anticipated such a powerful army to arrive so fast, and so were extremely unprepared for Napoleon's attack. Napoleon, instead of suprise-attacking Mack, marched his army around him at lightning speed. He quickly encirles Mack's 60 thousand strong army, and forced them to surrender after a few attempts at breakout in just over a month. It was Napoleon's masterpiece. The best campaign that he had ever fought. <i>"I have destroyed the Austrian army by simply marching"</i> Napoleon had said after the battle. Hearing of the news of Mack's Defeat, Senior Russian General Mikhail Kutuzov retreated with his corps of around 100 thousand men, as he now knew Napoleon was commanding almost 200 thousand, and could not fight him in a pitched battle without reinforcements. At the same time Napoleon was crushing the Austrian army at Ulm, British Admiral Horatio Nelson was crushing the allied Spanish-French fleet at Trafalgar. Although he had died in the battle, he secured British naval supremacy for the next century. Napoleon did not know of the disaster at Trafalgar, and so he continued with his campaign. </p>
      
      <p> Napoleon marched to Vienna, and Kutuzov could do nothing but watch as his army was too small to confront Napoleon. Although his position in the war was triumphant, there were still many enemy armies in the field. Seeking an open battle as his supply lines were overextended, Napoleon tried every which way to lure the enemy into an open battle. He pretended that his army was smaller than it was, that his army was cripped by supply problems and disease, even abandoning advantagous positions such as the Pratzen heights. The allies fell for it and engaged Napoleon at Austerlitz. During the battle, Napoleon deliberately weakened his right flank, hoping to lure the allies into a trap. The allies fell right into his trap. They sent more men to attack Napoleon's right flank, weakening their center on the Pratzen heights. Napoleon prompt sent men exploit this, destroying the enemy center, routing the right, and surrounding the left. It was another masterpiece by Napoleon. With 36 thousand dead or wounded enemies, and 9 thousand casualties, Napoleon had again proved that he could stand up to all the monarchs of Europe. Austria sued for peace, and Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. In addition, he forced Austria to formally dissolve the Holy Roman Empire, which had been around since the time of Otto the Great, in the 900s. This was a great embarrasment to Austria, which only made them hate France, especially Napoleon, even more. </p>

      <h3> <a name = "FourthCoalition"> The War of the Fourth Coalition </h3>

      <p> The allies were still bitter over their loss at Napoleon's hands in 1805. They reached out to Prussia; which had been debating whether or not to join the war since 1803. Eventually, the pro-war party, lead by the the King's wife, Queen Louise, won the debate. At the convincing of his wife, and his own desires to control central Europe, King of Prussia, Fredrick William III declared war on France. </p>

      <p> Prussia was a great addition to the allies; they now had the elite Prussian army on their side; trained by the infamous Fredrick the First the Great. The Prussian army was commanded by veteran commanders with decades of experience, and all of their soldiers were first class. The elite Prussian army consisted of 133 thousand infantry, 40 thousand cavalry, and 10 thousand artillerymen, as well as a few thousand engineers, reserves, etc., in total amounting to just over 200 thousand fighting men. But the Prussian armies had let themselves bask in the light of their victories and was no longer the elite force the Fredrick the Great had commanded, with it's commanders becoming arrogant and the soldiers rash. This would become disturbingly clear in the War of the Fourth Coalition. </p>

      <p> Although the Prussian army was only a shadow of it's former self, it was still a force to be reckoned with. But the ultimate mistake the Fredrick III had made was to declare war without consulting his newfound allies. This left him isolated without any support, and as Austria was still to weak from the deafeats of the last war, Napoleon seized on this opportunity, marching into Northern Germany with 180 thousand troops with lightning speed. Fredrick and his allies were not ready for this attack, and were forced to retreat, with Napoleon securing lands to the right of the River Saale. Opon learning of the whereabouts of the Prussian army, Napoleon swung west, aiming to defeat the Prussian army before it could be reinforced, sending his Marshal Davout to pursue the rear guard. But for once, Napoleon was wrong. The contingent that Napoleon attacked at Jena was actually the Prussian rear guard, while the "rear guard" that Napoleon had sent Marshal Davout to chase was actually the main Prussian column. Napoleon did not know this, however. As he flooded the Prussian rear guard with a mixture of superior numbers of stratigic cannon fire at Jena, more than 10 mile away, near the village of Auerstedt, Marshal Davout was fighting for his life. </p>

      <p> Marshals Davout and Bernadotte had recieved orders from Napoleon to reinforce him at Jena. Unexpectedly, Davout just so happened to encounter the main Prussian army of over 60 thousand men, against Davout's just over 20 thousand. Davout stood his ground, sent messengers to Napoleon, and tried to hold on for as long as possible. At this point, the condition of the Prussian army began to show itself. There was almost not a single Prussian commander under 60 years of age, and they still used tactics from the time of Fredrick the Great. The soldiers were let bask in their previous victories, and had barely ever trained. In addition, the communcations between the Prussian contingents, to put it nicely, was absolutely garbage. The 71 year olf Duke of Brunswick commanded the Prussian forces, and tried to send men to dislodge Davout. He could not do so, and ordered a full-scale frontal assault. This failed as well, with huge casualties, including the Duke's eyes. The Prussians finally retreated after almost ten attempts to break Davout's line, and a French counter-attack. Davout suffered casualities of around 7 thousand, while inflicting more than 13 thousand casualities on the enemy. </p>

      <p> At the news of Davout's victory, the French Emperor's first reaction was exclaiming <i>"Your marshal must be seeing double!"</i>, citing Davout's poor eyesight. His disbelief quickly turned to praise, proclaiming Davout "The Iron Marshal". Meanwhile, Marshal Bernadotte was almost court-martialed for failing to come to Davout's aid. Exploiting his victory, Napoleon entered Berlin triumphantly, allowing Marshal Davout's Corps to enter first as a tribute to their victory at Jena. Meanwhile, Fredrick William was leading the shattered remains of his formerly glorious army to Königsberg (modern day Kalingrad). The proud Prussian were absolutely decimated by Napoleon's lightning campaign, capturing over 140 thousand soldiers, more than 2 thousand cannon, and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in less than a month. As Historian David Chandler said:  “Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered”. Despite their catastrophic defeat, the Prussian refused to negotiate with the French, as Fredrick was confident that the Russians would come and save him. </p>

      <p> Indeed, the Russian Tsar Alexander I sent Levin August von Bennigsen to relieve the beleaguered Prussians retreating towards Königsberg. The Prussian and Russian armies met up, and Bennigsen counterattacked. Davout, who was on the front, fell back, inflicting losses. Napoleon, instead of seeing this as a disadvantage, came up with a plan. He ordered Davout to continue retreating, sending a courier to Bernadotte to encircle the now everextended Russian army. Luckily for the Bennigsen, however, the courier tasked with dispatching this information was fresh out of a military academy, and when captured, did not destroy the message. Therefore, Prince Bagration informed Bennigsen, who retreated immediately. The French Emperor was furious. Napoleon, seeking an open battle and still fuming at his failure to encircle the Russian army, Napoleon gathered his forces and chased the Bennigsen relentlessly, with Bennigsen only managing to escape by the skin of his teeth. Eventually, though, as Napoleon neared the Prussian stronghold of Königsberg, Bennigsen was forced to stand at fight. Bennigsen made his stand near the village of Preussisch-Eylau, where Napoleon converged on him. </p>

      <p> At Eylau, a bloodbath ensued. It was the first battle Napoleon had fought that concluded to be indecisive, and the battle was one of the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars. After the battle, Marshal Ney exclaimed, <i>"What a massacre! And without result!"</i>". Hostilities continued, with Bennigsen escaping across the Vistula River. Napoleon anticipated that Bennigsen would cross at Friedland, and sent Davout and Lannes to patrol the area. Bennigsen did indeed attempt to cross at Friedland, and Davout sent a message to the French Emperor, saying to his Aide-de-camp, <i>"Run your horse to the groud if you have to, but tell the Emperor that we are facing the entire Russian army!"</i>. Napoleon rushed to Friedland, surveyed the position, and then attacked. The Russians were surrounded, one side by Napoleon, the other by the river. They were annihilated. At this, Alexander I sued for peace, and peace was made at the Treaties of Tilsit. The Prussian got the short end of the stick; losing half of their lands. </p>
